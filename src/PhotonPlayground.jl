# The Unitary matrix associated with a Beamsplitter
"""
    U(θ, λ) = [cos(θ) (-e^(im*λ))*sin(θ);(e^(-im*λ))*sin(θ) cos(θ)]

The Unitary matrix associated with beam splitter, U(Β{θ,λ}), where θ
and λ are determined by the reflection amplitude ɼ and the transmission
amplitude τ.

# Examples
```julia-repl
julia> U(pi/2, pi/2)
[6.12323e-17+0.0im  -6.12323e-17-1.0im;
 6.12323e-17-1.0im   6.12323e-17+0.0im]

- `λ`: 2nd Angle

# A Better defined Unitary matrix associated with a Beamsplitter
"""
    UB(θ) = [cos(θ) -im*sin(θ);-im*sin(θ) cos(θ)]

This is a more simplified, albeit accurate representation of the
Unitary matrix that can be associated with a beamsplitter. θ is determined by the reflection amplitude ɼ and the transmission amplitude τ

# Examples
```julia-repl
julia> qp.UB(pi/2)
[6.12323e-17+0.0im 0.0-1.0im;
 0.0-1.0im 6.12323e-17+0.0im]

# The Phase Shift Operator P written as UP
"""
    UP(θ) = [e^(im*θ) 0;0 1]

This gate is equivalent to a rotation of -θ around the z-axis

# Examples
```julia-repl
julia> UP(pi)
[-1.0+1.22465e-16im 0.0+0.0im;

"""
UP(θ) = [e^(im*θ) 0;0 1]

# An Identity matrix keeping the imaginary portion coherent
"""
    UI = Rotation(UB(pi/2), 2pi)

This acts just like an Identity Gate but it also applies to an imaginary 
element of a matrices inversion coherently.
